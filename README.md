https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/chart-the-stock-market

### User stories:

* I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

* I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

* I can remove stocks.

* I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

### Setup:
Rename file `/config/config_template.json` to `/config/config.json` and edit it to replace the placeholder data.

Install node modules:  
`$ npm i`

Build output file:  
`$ npm run build`

Run:  
`$ npm start`  
The app will run on localhost at port specified in `production` key in `/config/config.json`
